                        <h4>Introducing your new pet to other pets in your home</h4>
                        <p>While your excitement level is high, the pets currently living in your home may be less enthusiastic about welcoming a new member. To be fair, this is likely coming as a surprise (shock, even!) to them. One day it’s business as usual, the next there is a stranger living amongst them.

                            The good news is that pets can happily coexist if you oversee their introduction and support steady integration.</p>
