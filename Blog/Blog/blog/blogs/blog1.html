                    <p>Now that you have the essentials in place, you can start to think about training, socializing, and enriching your pet’s day-to-day life.<br>

                        If you’re a new cat parent, there are countless ways you can enrich their environment to provide mental stimulation, physical exercise, and help calm their new home nerves.<br>
                        
                        There are various ways in which dog parents can also help their pets adjust to their new home and surroundings.<br>
                        
                       <b> House training</b> is essential. While some dogs (and cats, for that matter) pick up house training easily, some need a little extra help knowing when and where to go. And during your first day with a new puppy, you’ll definitely want to start them off on the right foot with a consistent and age-appropriate house training routine. <br>
                        <b>Obedience training</b> helps your dog build their confidence, establish and strengthen your bond, and prevent unwanted behaviours. It’s also something that many cat parents opt to do for added bonding and to introduce enrichment to their cat’s routine.<br>
                       <br> <p>Knowing how to take care of a pet includes understanding the importance of obedience training and incorporating it into your daily routine with your new pet. Get started by reading about training techniques, watching videos, hiring a private trainer, or joining a group obedience class.</p>
                        
                        Socializing your new dog or cat will help them to adjust and interact with the world around them without fear or anxiety. This can be started at any age, however older pets who have been poorly socialized will require a slow and steady approach with a lot of positive reinforcement and patience.<br>
                        Socialization includes: acquainting them with their new home and neighbourhood, introducing them to family and friends, creating comfort around children, and spending time with other pets (inside and outside of the home).<br>
                        
                        <b>Tip:</b> The dog park is a great place to socialize your new dog, but be aware of dog park etiquette and always watch your dog’s body language for cues as to their comfort level.<br>
                        
                        for some,the dog park is overwhelming and they’d rather watch the fun from a distance. For these pups, setting up a playdate with one other dog may be a better way to build their confidence through socialization.<br>
                        
                        Enrichment activities like puzzle games or scent/sniff activities are a great way to engage your pup’s mind and soothe separation anxiety.<br>
                        Beginning training and socialization right away is ideal but as they say, it’s never too late to teach an old dog new tricks. For help, you may want to consult with a trainer in your area who has experience, particularly in working with newly adopted pets</p>
